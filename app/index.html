        Stylesheets and Preprocessors
        ==============================

        You can always bring in CSS files manually with `<link>` tags, or asynchronously
        using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can take advantage 
        of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

        By default, stylesheets from your `app/styles` folder are included
        here automatically (between `inject:css start` and `inject:css end`). Both CSS (.css) and SASS (.scss)
        are supported. In production, your styles will be minified and concatenated into
        a single file.
        
        To customize any part of the built-in behavior, just edit `tasks/pipeline.js`.
        For example, here are a few things you could do:
            
            + Change the order of your CSS files
            + Import stylesheets from other directories
            + Use a different or additional preprocessor, like LESS or Stylus

    <!-- inject:css end -->

    Client-side Javascript
    ========================

    You can always bring in JS files manually with `script` tags, or asynchronously
    on the client using a solution like AMD (RequireJS).  Or, if you like, you can 
    take advantage of Sails' conventional asset pipeline (boilerplate Gruntfile).

    By default, files in your `app/scripts` folder are included here
    automatically (between `inject:js start` and `inject:js end`).  Both JavaScript (.js) and
    CoffeeScript (.coffee) are supported. In production, your scripts will be minified
    and concatenated into a single file.

    For example, here are a few things you could do:

        + Import scripts from other directories
        + Use a different preprocessor, like TypeScript
